The <b> objective </b> of this work was to study network-like patterns of cerebral blood flow in youth with and without bipolar disorder. 

Through hierarchical clustering, we observed that cerebral blood flow is organized into patterns that qualitatively map onto the brain's vascular territories. This pattern was consistent between youth with and without bipolar disorder. In bipolar disorder however, the details of this blood flow pattern were <i> more similar </i> to network-like patterns of brain structure.
